## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
ğŸš€ Welcome to the world of Adrian Xavier Boek! ğŸŒŸ

ğŸ”­ Currently, my focus is on crafting the ultimate experience with my Mafia Manager project. Trust me, it's going to be epic!

ğŸŒ± Always pushing the boundaries, I'm diving deep into the world of electron app development, seeking new horizons to conquer and innovative solutions to build.

ğŸ“« Don't hesitate to reach out! Whether you want to chat about code, collaborate on a project, or just say hi, my inbox is always open: adrian.x.boek@gmail.com

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him â€“ because every story needs a protagonist, right?

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not busy coding, you'll find me mastering the art of education as a dedicated student at Porsgrunn Upper Secondary School.
